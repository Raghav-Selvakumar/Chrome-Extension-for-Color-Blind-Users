# Chrome-Extension-for-Color-Blind-Users
This Chrome extension helps colorblind users by providing 8 filters for different types of color blindness. Users can enable filters based on their needs. Additionally, when viewing an image in a new tab, a small box near the cursor shows the color of the pixel the cursor points to.
